# Pastebin with GitHub Pages

Forked from @benkaiser - Thanks dude! Check out [his original](https://github.com/benkaiser/pages-pastebin)

This repository is a proof of concept for making a GitHub Pages site using a [Public Action Trigger](https://github.com/apps/public-action-trigger).

Works with image uploads <60 kb due to restrictions on client payload size from github.
